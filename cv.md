## About me
Graphic designer, photographer. During the pandemic, i quit my office job. I am currently freelancing. I decided to acquire new skills in layout and programming in order to find an interesting and highly paid job in the future.

I studied the layout of sites by myself, as I wanted to make up a test site with my photos, but I did not know how to do it. As a result, first I took a mini-course at the HTML Academy, and then I found courses at the RS School.
